# Props Drilling Example

This React app demonstrates props drilling by passing the user's name from the `App` component to a deeply nested component (`BottomMainRight`).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Type your name in the input, and see it appear in the bottom nested component.
